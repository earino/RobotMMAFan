## Description

This is the dumbest codebase you have ever seen. Seriously, this is some
totally crap code that I've put together because I like causing trouble.
Under no circumstances should this code be used to judge me as a programmer,
please... Seriously.

Now that you've been warned. This code streams the JSON of the UFC Fighters
list, and compares that to our database of "slurs and hate words" and
will then retweet any fighter who says something really objectionable.

Mind you, there's lots of false positives and it's crap, but that's what
the first paragraph was about.

## For further reading

How about a real book? Or something about the nature of human struggle against
capitalist oppression? Whatever, there are lots of options.

No seriously, I guarantee you it is.

## Who to blame?

@earino is mainly to blame. Good luck with that though.
